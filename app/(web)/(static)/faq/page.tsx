                Our custom design process begins with a consultation where we
                discuss your vision, budget, and timeline. Our designers create
                sketches and 3D renderings for your approval. Once approved, our
                master craftsmen begin creating your piece. The entire process
                typically takes 4-8 weeks, depending on complexity.

                initial consultation. Our custom pieces typically start around
                $2,000 and can range significantly higher for elaborate designs
                with premium materials.

                Yes, all our jewelry comes with a lifetime warranty against

                loose settings, or structural problems that occur under normal
                wear. The warranty does not cover damage from accidents, normal

                is lost due to damage or normal wear, we can replace it for the
                cost of the stone plus a small setting fee. We recommend annual
                inspections to prevent stone loss.
